# MomentsMethod
A short project to create python code to find the mean and standard deviation for an output given inputs and a function

Currently, if there are any discontinuties or signifcant non-linearities, then they are not highlighted (this would be good to add at soem time.

## Getting Started
Downlaod the files and run them in Python

## Prerequisites
You will need to download numpy

## Example
The file app.py gives an exmaple of how to use the functions with an arpitrary function and input variables

## Running the tests
Run app.p to see the results. For this content in app.py, the putputs should be:
6100.29999999997 #mean
982.100257920096 #standard deviation
